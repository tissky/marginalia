"""Chat HTTP route — DESIGN.md §12.2 / plan §5.5.

  POST /chat/{session_id}      — run one user turn as SSE event stream

The agent runtime (`marginalia.agent.runtime.run_turn`) is an async
generator yielding AgentEvent frames. This route wraps it as a proper
text/event-stream response. Each frame becomes one SSE event with
`event:` set to event_type and `data:` carrying the payload.

Event types (see AgentEvent docstring): conversation / planning / plan /
thinking / tool_call / tool_result / answer / error / done.

reflect_turn is enqueued by run_turn at finalize time, before the `done`
event is yielded — there's no separate end-of-turn hook.

## Per-session serialisation

`run_turn` is documented (agent/runtime.py module docstring) as assuming
one in-flight turn per session — concurrent calls race on the
`latest_turn_index() + 1` read-modify-write and silently write two
conversations with the same turn_index.

We enforce that here with a per-session asyncio.Lock, held for the
entire lifetime of the SSE stream. Locks live in a plain dict keyed by
session_id. We don't bother evicting — sessions are coarse and
long-lived (one per UI tab open), and a Lock is ~200 bytes; the
process restarts long before this becomes a memory concern.
(WeakValueDictionary was tried first; it doesn't work because the lock
has no other strong reference between requests, so each call sees a
fresh lock and the serialisation collapses.)

Cross-process safety is the database's job: `conversations` carries
UNIQUE(session_id, turn_index), so a multi-worker Postgres deploy still
fails closed (the second writer hits IntegrityError) instead of
producing duplicate rows.
